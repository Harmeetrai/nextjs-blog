Hi there! My name is Harmeet and I am an entry-level programmer. I am currently finishing my computer science degree at Simon Fraser University. During my studies, I gained experience in a variety of programming languages such as Java, Python, C, and JavaScript.

I am eager to apply my knowledge and continue learning as a member of a collaborative and innovative team. In my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest technology trends and tinkering with new programming projects. I am excited to start my career and see where my passion for coding takes me.
